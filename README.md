This simple Python app let's you convert an Excel File into a CSV. The app has a GUI, made with PySimpleGUI.

I coded the app closely following this great tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzCfNanQ_9c

I only made minor changes to the code taught in the tutorial, as it's my very first GUI Experience.
